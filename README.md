- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mjjurow
- ðŸ‘€ I work at the intersection of software engineering, machine learning and applied AI. Right now that means i'm ingesting and processing very large unstructured data sets into knowledge graph architectures. You can see some of my older/academic projects in action here https://www.matthewjurow.com/software-projects if you're interested in my chemistry/physics/optics/materials science background.
